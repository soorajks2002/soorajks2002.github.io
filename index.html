                        I am a software engineer passionate about building scalable systems and elegant solutions.
                        Currently focused on creating robust architectures that serve millions of users while
                        mentoring developers and sharing knowledge through technical writing.

                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        I spend my days architecting and building full-stack applications that perform under pressure.
                        From designing APIs that handle 100k+ requests per minute to optimizing database queries
                        and crafting intuitive user interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My expertise spans modern JavaScript frameworks, Python backends, and cloud infrastructure.
                        But beyond the technical stack, I'm passionate about writing maintainable code that
                        solves real problems for real people.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Currently Working On</h2>
                    <p>
                        Leading development of microservices architecture at TechCorp that handles over 1 million
                        daily active users. The challenges are fascinatingâ€”from implementing distributed caching
                        strategies to designing fault-tolerant systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also exploring the intersection of performance optimization and developer experience,
                        finding ways to make systems faster without sacrificing code clarity.
