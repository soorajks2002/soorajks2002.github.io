# Welcome to My Blog

This is my very first blog post created using the new streamlined pipeline! 

## What's Different?

- **Everything is organized** in the blog directory
- **No more scattered files** across multiple folders
- **Simple workflow** for creating new posts
- **Clean structure** that's easy to maintain

## How I Created This

1. Created this markdown file in `blog/my-first-post.md`
2. Added the frontmatter with title and date
3. Wrote the content in markdown
4. Generated the HTML using the pipeline

## Next Steps

I can now easily create new blog posts by:
- Writing in **markdown** (much easier than HTML)
- Using the **template system** for consistency
- **No boilerplate** to copy and paste

This is so much better than manually creating HTML files!
