# Getting Started with Clean Architecture

Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes **separation of concerns** and **dependency inversion**. It helps create systems that are:

## Key Benefits

- **Testable**: Business logic is independent of frameworks
- **Flexible**: Easy to change external dependencies  
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- **Framework Independent**: Not tied to specific technologies

## The Layers

### 1. Entities (Core Business Logic)
The innermost layer containing business rules and domain models.

### 2. Use Cases (Application Logic)
Contains application-specific business rules and orchestrates data flow.

### 3. Interface Adapters
Converts data between use cases and external frameworks.

### 4. Frameworks & Drivers
The outermost layer with databases, web frameworks, and external APIs.

## Getting Started

1. **Start with entities** - Define your core business models
2. **Create use cases** - Implement your application logic
3. **Build adapters** - Connect to external systems
4. **Wire everything together** - Configure dependency injection

Clean architecture takes time to master, but the benefits are worth the investment!

## Next Steps

- Read "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin
- Practice with small projects
- Focus on dependency direction
- Test your business logic in isolation
