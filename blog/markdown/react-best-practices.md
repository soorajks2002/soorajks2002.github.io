# React Best Practices for 2024

React development has evolved significantly, and staying up-to-date with best practices is crucial for building **modern, maintainable applications**.

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Use React.memo Wisely
Don't wrap every component in `React.memo`. Only use it when:
- The component receives complex props
- Re-renders are expensive
- Parent re-renders frequently

### 2. Optimize Bundle Size
- Use code splitting with `React.lazy()`
- Implement proper tree shaking
- Analyze bundle with tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer`

## State Management

### Modern Approaches
- **useState** for local component state
- **useReducer** for complex state logic
- **Context** for shared state (sparingly)
- **Zustand** or **Jotai** for global state

### Avoid These Pitfalls
- Don't put everything in global state
- Avoid prop drilling with multiple context providers
- Don't store derived state

## Component Design

### Composition over Configuration
```jsx
// Good: Composition
<Modal>
  <ModalHeader>Title</ModalHeader>
  <ModalBody>Content</ModalBody>
</Modal>

// Avoid: Configuration
<Modal 
  title="Title" 
  content="Content"
  showHeader={true}
/>
```

### Custom Hooks
Extract complex logic into reusable custom hooks:
```jsx
function useLocalStorage(key, defaultValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
    return localStorage.getItem(key) ?? defaultValue;
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, value);
  }, [key, value]);
  
  return [value, setValue];
}
```

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests** for utilities and hooks
- **Integration tests** for components
- **E2E tests** for critical user flows
- Use **React Testing Library** for component testing

Following these practices will lead to more robust and maintainable React applications!
